# Some effects should be included, like Reverb and Delay.

def Reverb(signal):
    # How to implement this? Would it be better as a class or as a function? 
	# For now we go with a function call.
    #
    # A simple protype reverb effect could be implemented using all-pass filters.
    #
    # Furthermore, we can utilize comb filters for a basic sound, and then 
	# enhance the effect with all-pass filters. We can show the incremental
	# addition of filters and demonstrate each component's contribution.
